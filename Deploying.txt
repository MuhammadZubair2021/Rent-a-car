Steps to deploy a new node js application to heroku...
1. SignUp into heroku.
Now commands (in terminal) starts 
2. type heroku login and type your credentials.
3. Now initialize git by typing git init ( Make sure that you have git installed).
4. Check for anything need to be added or commited by typing git status.
5. Add those untracked files by typing git add file name like git add app.js or git add package.json etc.
6. Now commit those need to be commited by typing git commit -m "your message for commit"
7. Now creat space on heroku server by typing heroku create.
8. Last but not least, push all the files by typing git push heroku master
......

If its show an error like (App error) come back to terminal and type heroku logs
it will show you all the errors, The error i think about will be missing start script.
So to remove that error go to package.json search for scripts object and put start script like -> "start":"node app.js " 

NOw as we modified package.json file so we need to add this-> git add package.json.
and also need changes to be commited -> git commit -m "YOur message like add start script in package.json".
Now all we need to do is type -> git push heroku master
Hope it will work and enjoy your app online.
